# Labyrinthe C++



This involves programming in C++ the creation and graphical visualization of a labyrinth
which a user must exit from an initial position to a final position
output. For the GUI, you will use the Gtkmm library. The user
will move through the maze using the 4 arrows on the computer keyboard.
You will propose several mazes of variable sizes built automatically.
The automatic generation of mazes will necessarily follow two algorithms: Fu-
and Aldous-Broder, presented in the resources given below.
The following resources will be helpful:

- https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modélisation_mathématique_d’un_labyrinthe

Remember to implement the notion of graph as indicated by the first url.
The project is not frozen, you can bring all the extensions you want.
